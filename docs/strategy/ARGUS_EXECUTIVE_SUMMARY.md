# ARGUS - Executive Summary

**AI-Powered Autonomous E2E Testing Platform**

---

## The Problem

Engineering teams spend **80% of QA time on test maintenance**, not actual testing. Every UI change breaks selectors, tests are slow to create, and flaky tests erode confidence. Traditional tools don't understand your codebase—they only see the DOM.

## The Solution

**Argus** is a fully autonomous testing platform that generates tests from plain English and self-heals broken tests. Works with **zero code access** (90-95% healing) or with optional git integration for **99.9% accuracy**.

```
"Login as admin and verify dashboard shows 5 widgets" → Complete executable test
```

## Deployment Options

**Git-aware healing is OPTIONAL. Argus works with zero code access.**

| Mode | Code Access | Healing Accuracy | Best For |
|------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| **DOM-Only** | None required | 90-95% | Privacy-first, quick POCs, agencies |
| **Git-Aware** | Read-only | 99.9% | Teams wanting maximum reliability |
| **Self-Hosted** | On-premise | 99.9% | Enterprise, regulated industries |

**DOM-Only still includes:** AI test generation, visual regression, multi-model savings, all 23 agents

## Key Differentiators

| Advantage | What It Means | Impact |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| **Flexible Deployment** | DOM-only, Git-aware, or Self-hosted options | Works for any security requirement |
| **Git-Aware Self-Healing** | Reads git blame + source code (optional) | 99.9% accuracy vs 95% industry |
| **Multi-Model AI Routing** | Routes tasks to optimal LLM (Claude/GPT/Gemini) | 60-80% cost reduction |
| **Full Codebase Understanding** | Analyzes frontend, backend, database, and git | Tests that understand your app |
| **Production Learning** | Integrates Datadog/Sentry to prioritize tests | Real user impact drives testing |
| **MCP IDE Integration** | Works in Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf | Tests where developers live |

## Business Model

| Tier | Price | Test Runs | Deployment Mode |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Free | $0 | 100/mo | DOM-Only |
| Starter | $49 | 500/mo | DOM-Only |
| Pro | $99 | 2,000/mo | + Git-Aware |
| Team | $299 | 10,000/mo | + Git-Aware |
| Enterprise | Custom | Unlimited | + Self-Hosted |

**Customer ROI:** $150,000+ annual savings for mid-size teams (90% reduction in maintenance time)

## Roadmap Highlights

| Timeline | Milestone |
|----------|-----------|
| **Q1 2026** | Public beta, Gemini integration, hybrid DOM+Vision |
| **Q2 2026** | Enterprise SSO/RBAC, production monitoring |
| **Q3 2026** | Custom LLM fine-tuning, mobile native testing |

---

## Why Now?

1. **AI testing mainstream** - 60%+ enterprise adoption by 2025
2. **LLM costs dropping** - Gemini Flash at $0.10/M tokens (90% YoY decrease)
3. **Competitors stuck** - Still DOM-only, no codebase awareness, cloud-only deployment
4. **First mover advantage** - Only platform with git-aware healing AND flexible deployment options

## The Ask

Seeking strategic partners and early adopters to:
- Validate product-market fit with design partners
- Scale infrastructure for enterprise workloads
- Expand go-to-market capabilities
